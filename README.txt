"Vector as a Database"
This project is coded in Java
/******************************/
This program has 4 user defined data structures. First, we have the Team and Coach structures. These hold their respective data. Second, we have the TeamsVect and CoachesVect structures. Each of these define a vector of type Team or type Coach, respectively; they also define class functions to perform operations on those vectors of type Coach or Team. 

Each function is commented in the souce file.

Compilation:
--->To compile the code, use the javac compiler. Run the following code in the directory holding the source file: javac *.java
--->To run the code, use: java P1

'P1.java' was written by myself. 'Command.java' and 'CommandParser.java' were provided by Porfessor Yicheng Tu.
